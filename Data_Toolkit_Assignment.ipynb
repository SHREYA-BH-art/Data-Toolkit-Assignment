        "1. What is NumPy, and why is it widely used in Python?\n",
        "NumPy is a powerful Python library for numerical computing. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on them efficiently. NumPy is widely used because of its speed, ease of use, and ability to integrate with other libraries like SciPy, pandas, and scikit-learn. It uses optimized C code under the hood, making numerical operations much faster than standard Python. NumPy is essential for data science, machine learning, and scientific computing, forming the foundation for many advanced data manipulation and analysis tasks.\n",
        "2. How does broadcasting work in NumPy?\n",
        "A. Broadcasting in NumPy allows operations on arrays of different shapes without explicit replication. When performing element-wise operations, NumPy compares array shapes from right to left and automatically stretches the smaller array to match the larger one, if compatible. A dimension is compatible if it is equal or one. If alignment fails, an error is raised. This mechanism simplifies code and improves performance by avoiding unnecessary data duplication. Broadcasting is especially useful in vectorized computations, such as adding a scalar to an array or combining arrays of different but compatible shapes.\n",
        "3. What is a Pandas DataFrame?\n",
        "A. A Pandas DataFrame is a two-dimensional, labeled data structure in Python, similar to a table or spreadsheet. It consists of rows and columns, where each column can hold data of different types (e.g., integers, floats, strings). DataFrames are part of the Pandas library, which is widely used for data manipulation, analysis, and cleaning. They offer powerful tools for indexing, filtering, grouping, and handling missing data. You can create a DataFrame from various sources like dictionaries, CSV files, or databases, making it ideal for data science and machine learning tasks.\n",

        "\n",
        "* **`apply()`** is more flexible and can be used on both **Series and DataFrames**. It lets you apply a function along an axis (rows or columns) of a DataFrame or to each element of a Series. It supports more complex operations and aggregation.\n",
        "\n",
        "In short:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Use **`map()`** for simple element-wise mapping on Series.\n",
        "* Use **`apply()`** for more complex row/column-wise or element-wise operations on Series or DataFrames.\n",
        "18. What are some advanced features of NumPy?\n",
        "A. Some advanced features of NumPy include:\n",
